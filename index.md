# ASPIRE Lab
Welcome to the lab website.

The <b>ASPIRE Lab</b> advances the science and engineering of <b>autonomous robotic systems</b> capable of perceiving, learning, and acting intelligently in complex and uncertain environments. Our research spans a wide range of robotic platforms — from <b>swarms of aerial drones</b> for cooperative payload transport to <b>quadruped, biped, and humanoid robots</b>, as well as <b>flexible manipulators</b> designed for dynamic interaction and adaptability. Ongoing projects explore <b>hybrid aerial–aquatic drones</b>, <b>underwater robots</b>, <b>wheeled mobile robots</b>, and <b>biomimetic systems</b> inspired by nature.

Our core focus lies in integrating <b>conventional control theory</b> with <b>learning-based paradigms</b> such as <b>reinforcement learning</b> and <b>deep learning</b>, enabling robots to make adaptive, data-driven decisions in real time. We emphasize <b>robot vision</b> and <b>visual servoing</b> as key enablers of perception-guided autonomy — allowing robots to interpret and interact with their surroundings through advanced sensing and intelligent control. At <b>ASPIRE</b>, we aim to bridge the gap between <b>model-based design</b> and <b>data-driven intelligence</b>, shaping the next generation of <b>autonomous systems</b> for <b>exploration</b>, <b>interaction</b>, and <b>real-world deployment</b>
