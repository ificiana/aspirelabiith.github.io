Welcome to the lab website.

**ASPIRE Lab** at IITH advances the science and technology of autonomous robotic systems that can **perceive**, **learn**, and **act intelligently** in complex and uncertain environments. Our research covers a broad spectrum of robotic platforms - from swarms of aerial drones to quadruped, biped/humanoid robots, and underwater robots. 

Our work combines principles of conventional control theory with learning-based approaches such as deep reinforcement learning and robot vision to develop systems capable of adaptive, data-driven behavior. Through these efforts, ASPIRE aims to integrate model-based understanding with data-driven intelligence to develop reliable and efficient autonomous systems for exploration, interaction, and real-world operation.
