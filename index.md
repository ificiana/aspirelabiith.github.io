# ASPIRE Lab
Welcome to the lab website.

The ASPIRE Lab focuses on advancing the science and engineering of autonomous robotic systems capable of perceiving, learning, and acting intelligently in complex environments. Our work spans a diverse range of robotic platforms — from swarms of aerial drones for cooperative payload transport to quadruped, biped, and humanoid robots, as well as flexible manipulators designed for dynamic interaction and adaptability.

Current research explores hybrid aerial–aquatic drones, underwater robots, wheeled mobile robots, and biomimetic systems inspired by nature. The lab’s central theme lies in combining conventional control theory with learning-based approaches to achieve robust autonomy across these platforms.
