Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, IIT Hyderabad  

Welcome to the lab website.

**ASPIRE Lab** at IITH focuses on advancing **autonomous robotic systems** endowed with perception, learning, and intelligent decision-making in complex environments. Our research covers a broad spectrum of robotic platforms, including but not limited to, swarms of aerial drones, quadruped robots, biped / humanoid robots, wheeled mobile robots, and AUVs / underwater robots. 

Our work combines principles of conventional **control** theory with learning-based approaches such as **deep reinforcement learning** and **robot vision** to develop systems capable of adaptive, data-driven behavior. Through these efforts, **ASPIRE** aims to integrate model-based understanding with data-driven intelligence to develop reliable and efficient autonomous systems for **exploration**, interaction, and real-world operation.
